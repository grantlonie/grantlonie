# Grant Lonie portfolio site

Welcome to my portfolio site. It is built using [Gatsby JS](gatsbyjs.com) - a universal JS framework utilizing [React](reactjs.org). It also uses [chakra](chakra-ui.com) component library. If you want to use this as a starter for your own site, feel free to do so.

## Development

Running `npm start` will get the development server up and running. You can also choose to `npm run build` and `npm run serve` to test the production build.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on Gatsby Cloud, which auto-deploys as changes are pushed to `master` branch.
